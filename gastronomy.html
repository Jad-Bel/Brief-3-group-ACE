                        Moroccan pastilla is a savory-sweet pastry traditionally made with layers of thin, 
                        crisp warqa dough, filled with spiced meat, most commonly pigeon or chicken. The filling is a rich mixture of tender,
                         slow-cooked meat, almonds, eggs, and a fragrant blend of spices like cinnamon, saffron, and ginger. The pastry is often dusted with powdered sugar
                          and cinnamon after baking, creating a delightful contrast between the sweet, crispy exterior and the savory, aromatic filling.

                         The dish typically consists of tender meat—such as lamb, chicken, or beef—combined with a variety of vegetables, dried fruits 
                         (like apricots or prunes), and an aromatic blend of spices, including cumin, coriander, saffron, and cinnamon. The slow-cooking
                          method allows the ingredients to meld together, resulting in rich, deeply infused flavors.

                         It features a rich, tomato-based broth, thickened with a combination of lentils, chickpeas, and broken vermicelli noodles.
                          The soup is flavored with a blend of aromatic spices like cumin, turmeric, ginger, and cinnamon, which gives it a warm and
                           slightly spicy profile. Harira typically includes tender chunks of lamb or beef, though it can also be made vegetarian.
